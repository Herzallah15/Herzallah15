Hi there 👋  

I’m exploring how modern machine learning tools can be built from first principles and applied to various problems.

📌 Repositories include:
- Neural networks and generative models implemented in PyTorch  
- Educational notebooks focused on understanding, not just using, deep learning  
- Hadron correlator construction and tensor contraction tools for physics research  

Feel free to browse, use, or reach out.
